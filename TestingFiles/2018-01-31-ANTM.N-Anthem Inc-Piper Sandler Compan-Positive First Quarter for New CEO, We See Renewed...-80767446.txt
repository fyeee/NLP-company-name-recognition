Positive First Quarter for New CEO, We See Renewed Focus Driving LT Upside
We believe it was a solid first earnings call for new CEO Gail Boudreaux highlighting a
number of positive key initiatives including further investment into technology platforms
and a renewed focus on ANTM's historically lagging government business. We see the
reiteration of long-term guidance (10-14% EPS growth) but at the high end as a confidence
builder for our Overweight thesis with priorities shifting to 1) organic growth, 2) M&A, and
lastly 3) repurchases, compared to the repurchase heavy focus in years past.
 We believe we saw a tone change from ANTM on investing in technology with 25%
of tax reform benefit funding incremental investment. We think ANTM could look to
M&A in order to build out their technology platforms, including consumer facing digital
platforms, and product development capabilities. However, we believe they could also
make key hires in the area in order to build the right team for future development. Overall,
we see this leading to improved customer satisfaction, medical cost management, and
member engagement potentially through ER diversion programs that we view as the
most impactful, similar to what peers such as UNH are rolling out.
 We see ANTM renewing their focus on MA and see it becoming a larger portion
of the business, but not as big as peers such as UNH. Currently, we estimate MA
represents  ~12.5%  of  premiums  for  ANTM  compared  to  the  large  cap  peer  average
of 30.5%. However, we view management's comments and the recent acquisitions of
high quality MA plans (HealthSun and America's 1st Choice) as indications that this is
changing. We believe ANTM's focus on product innovation in group, an area they have
exerted much focus on in the past, and retail will drive organic growth in the low to mid
double digits over the next few years.
 We are fans of ANTM's new JVs with other Blues plans with BCBS of MN adding
~345K  Medicaid  members  to  ANTM's  book.  So  far,  ANTM  has  made  2  of  these
partnerships with another 240K member partnership with BCBS of LA during 2017. We
believe ANTM's local market share will help them win new contracts and drive further
Medicaid  growth.  However,  we  see  a  need  for  ANTM  to  develop  a  narrow,  low  cost
Medicaid focus provider network in order to be more successful in the Medicaid industry.
 2018 Cost Trend guidance up 50 bps from 2017 to ~6%, but we believe this is due
to conservatism from ANTM (6 beats since 2010) and a bad flu season. We estimate
ANTM's restatement of cost trend, reflecting the contractual rate paid to providers, lowers
historical cost trends by ~100 bps, which brings historical cost trends more inline with
peers. One area that could drive upside is VBC, which is an area that we believe new
CEO Gail Boudreaux could improve in year 1, while incremental investments into vertical
integration and technology could drive upside long-term.
Increased medical cost trends, reimbursement, competition and the CI deal being blocked.
Second largest managed-care company with a focus on commercial plans.

Earnings Comparison and Guidance Table
 Reiterating our Overweight rating and raising our PT to $278 (up 
from $260). Our $278 price target is based on 16.7x (down from 
18.2x) our 2019E EPS of $16.63 (up from $14.28). We have raised our 
estimates to reflect our increased confidence in ANTMs long-term 
growth profile and the positive impact from tax reform. We lowered our 
multiple to fall more inline with post tax reform multiples, however we 
believe ANTM deserves a premium to the peer group average of 16.3x 
given their incremental investment into technology and consumer 
facing platforms along with a renewed focus on the faster growing 
government business (Medicare and Medicaid).
